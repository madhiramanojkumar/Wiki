    <p>A <strong>cryptocurrency</strong>, <mark>crypto-currency</mark>, or crypto[a] is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.<br>[2]

        Individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger, which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, control the creation of additional coins, and verify the transfer of coin ownership.[3][4][5] Despite the term that has come to describe many of the fungible blockchain tokens that have been created, cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense, and varying legal treatments hae been applied to them in various jurisdicitons, including classification as commodities, securities, and currencies. Cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice.[6][7][8] Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. In return, they get authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake. </p>

        <h2>History</h2>
<hr>
<p>In 1983, American cryptographer David Chaum conceived of a type of cryptographic electronic money called ecash.[14][15] Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash,[16] an early form of cryptographic electronic payments. Digicash required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before they could be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by a third party.<br>

    In 1996, the National Security Agency published a paper entitled How to Make a Mint: The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash, describing a cryptocurrency system. The paper was first published in an MIT mailing list (October 1996) and later (April 1997) in The American Law Review.[17]</p>
<h2>Formal definition</h2>
<hr>
<p>According to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions:[37]

    The system does not require a central authority; its state is maintained through distributed consensus.
    The system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership.
    The system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created, the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units.
    Ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically.
    The system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. A transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units.
    If two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered, the system performs at most one of them.<br> <br>
    <i> March 2018, the word cryptocurrency was added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.[38]</i></p>
    <h3>Altcoins</h3>
    <hr>
    <p><i>information: List of cryptocurrencies</i></p>
    <p>After the early innovation of Bitcoin in 2008, and the early network effect gained by Bitcoin, tokens, cryptocurrencies, and other digital assets that were not Bitcoin became collectively known during the 2010s as alternative cryptocurrencies,[39][40][41] or "altcoins."[42] Sometimes the term "alt coins" was used,[43][44] or disparagingly, "shitcoins".[45] Paul Vigna of The Wall Street Journal described altcoins in 2020 as "alternative versions of Bitcoin"[46] given its role as the model protocol for cryptocurrency designers. A Polytechnic University of Catalonia thesis in 2021 used a broader description including not only alternative versions of Bitcoin, but every cryptocurrency other than bitcoin. "As of early 2020, there were more than 5,000 cryptocurrencies. Altcoin is the combination of two words "alt" and "coin" and includes all alternatives to Bitcoin."[42]: 14 </p>
<br>
<p>Altcoins often have underlying differences when compared to Bitcoin. For example, Litecoin aims to process a block every 2.5 minutes, rather than Bitcoin's 10 minutes, which allows Litecoin to confirm transactions faster than Bitcoin.[22] Another example is Ethereum, which has smart contract functionality that allows decentralized applications to be run on its blockchain.[47] Ethereum was the most used blockchain in 2020, according to Bloomberg News.[48] In 2016, it had the largest "following" of any altcoin, according to the New York Times.[49]</p>
